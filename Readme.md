# Let's Guess Project

Initally this project was made for an introduction CS class that I took roughly a few months back, with this being the final project needed to be completed. It was intended to show in the code different functions and coding structures, more or less wasnt suer focused on what the actual project outcome was, **just that it worked**.

## Orignal Readme File
Below is the orginally explination of the code, feel free to change, alter, or do as you want with this code.

This program is supposed to be a simple game about guessing numbers.
You select how many numbers you wish to guess, and then you attempt to figure out what each number is (between 0 and 10).
The main goal of the game is to correctly guess what the numbers are in under three tries.

##### Outcome
At the end of the game, win or lose, a file is written called `GuessNumResults.txt` that lists what the numbers were, and
whether or not you were able to correctly guess all numbers under three tries.
