This program is supposed to be a simple game about guessing numbers.
You select how many numbers you wish to guess, and then you attempt to figure out what each number is (between 0 and 10).
The main goal of the game is to correctly guess what the numbers are in under three tries.

At the end of the game, win or lose, a file is written called "GuessNumResults.txt" that lists what the numbers were, and
whether or not you were able to correctly guess all numbers under three tries.
